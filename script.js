  // Usage example:
  const bill = Employee.addEmployee("Bill", "Doe", "bill@example.com", "1990-01-01", 50000);
  console.log(bill);

  bill.editEmployee({ salary: 7777777, email: "xxxxxxx@example.com" });
  console.log(bill);


//ES6 way - CLASSES - Create a new Employee class that adds a new employee and console logs them
// Goals:
// 1. Create a new Employee class with a constructor for Employee giving them a firstname, lastname, email, and birthdate
// 2. Instantiate (i.e. create a new instance) of an Employee with your info and save it to a const with your first name
// 3. After step 2, console log your const and then try to console.log parts of the object
// 4. Then create a const array that creates many "new Employee" objects and says to an array.  Console this object as a whole and parts of it
// 5. Add methods to your class to "getEmployees" which just returns all the fields in the object.
//    Also add methods to addEmployee (this will be static) and a method to editEmployee
//    Test your methods using JS
// 6. Try to get instances of your class object to display in the table.  You can set the innerhtml of the
//    of the table to be empty and then replace it with the looped-through values of your object





//Try to output 3 instances of your class object into the table
